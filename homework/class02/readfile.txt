Loki: I am Loki, of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose.
Selvig: Loki, brother of Thor.
Nick Fury: We have no quarrel with your people.
Loki: An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
Nick Fury: You planning to step on us?
Loki: I come with glad tidings. Of a world made free.
Nick Fury: Free from what?
Loki: Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... [taps Selvig with the spear] you will know peace.
Nick Fury: Yeah, you say peace. I kinda think you mean the other thing.
